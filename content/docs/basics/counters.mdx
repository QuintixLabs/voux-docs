## Overview

The counter is the main feature of **Voux**. It simply counts views.

You can create a counter either from the main page **(if the instance is public)** or from the dashboard if you are logged in.

When creating a counter, you can choose between two modes:

### Unique

**This mode counts only one visit per IP.**

If the same IP visits the page again, it will not increase the counter.
This is useful if you want something closer to **"real"** visitors.

### Every-visit

**This mode counts every page load.**

Refreshing the page will increase the counter each time, depending on the throttle setting.
By default, the throttle is `0s`, meaning every refresh counts.

You can think of this like an old-school hit counter from early web days.

After creating a counter, Voux gives you a small embed script.
Once you place it on your website, views will start counting automatically.

<strong>From the dashboard, you can also edit counters, add notes, and use filters to manage them.</strong>

## Styling your counter

Styling your counter with **Voux** is super simple.  
All you need to do is wrap the embed script inside an element.

Here is a basic example using a `<span>`:

```html title="HTML"
<span class="counter-widget">
  <!-- replace this with your counter script -->
  <script async src="https://your-domain/embed/abc123.js"></script>
</span>
```

Once that is in place, you can style it however you want using normal CSS.

Here is a simple example that centers the counter on the screen and makes the text black:

```css title="CSS"
.counter-widget {
  position: fixed;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  text-align: center;
  color: black;
  font-weight: 600;
  font-size: 3rem;
  font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

That is it. Your counter is now styled and ready to use.
You can change the **font**, **colors**, **size**, or **layout** however you like.
