## Overview

Voux stores all of its data locally on disk. This includes your counters, their values, notes, tags, settings, users, and activity stats.

---

### Full data backup

If you want a complete backup of everything, copy the `data/` folder.

This folder contains:
- the SQLite database
- the config file
- all runtime data used by Voux

Copying this folder gives you a full snapshot of your instance.
Restoring it later will bring everything back exactly as it was.

This is the **recommended option** if you care about keeping **everything**.

---

### JSON backups from the dashboard

If you only care about counters, you can download a `JSON` backup from the dashboard.

This backup includes:
- counters
- values
- notes
- labels
- tags
- activity stats

This is useful if you want to move counters to another instance, keep a lightweight backup, or restore counters without touching users or configuration.

### Which one should I use?

- Use the **full data backups** for full restores and long-term safety
- Use **JSON backups** for sharing, migration, or quick exports
