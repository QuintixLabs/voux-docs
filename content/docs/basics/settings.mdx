## Overview

This page covers the settings that change how your **Voux** instance behaves.
Most options are self explanatory in the UI, so only the important ones are explained here.

---

## Public vs Private instance

When **Private mode** is enabled, only logged in users can create new counters.
When it is **disabled**, anyone can create counters.

**Private mode is useful if:**
- Your Voux instance is publicly accessible
- You want to prevent abuse
- You only want trusted users creating counters

---

## Every visit throttle

This setting is only for counters using **Every-visit** mode.

In simple terms, it controls how often the same person can increase the counter.

For example, if you set the throttle to **10 seconds**:
- You refresh the page once → the counter goes up by **1**
- You refresh again within those **10** seconds → it does **not** count
- Once the **10** seconds pass → the next visit counts again

This helps stop spammy refreshes, accidental double counts, and bots hammering the same page.

If you set the value to `0`, throttling is disabled and every refresh is counted.

## Delete counters inactive for 30 days

This option lets you automatically delete counters that have not received any hits
for a certain number of days.

If a counter stays inactive for **30 days**, it will first show an **INACTIVE 30D** badge in the dashboard.
This lets you see which counters are no longer being used before they are deleted.

It is useful if:
- You run a public instance
- You want to keep the dashboard clean
- You do not care about old, unused counters

Counters that are still receiving hits are never affected.

## Backup & Restore

Voux lets you back up your counters so you do not lose your data.

You can download a backup of your counters as a **JSON** file from the dashboard.
The backup includes everything you see in the dashboard: values, notes, labels, tags, and other related data.

Restoring a backup will recreate the counters from the file.
This is useful if you:
- Move Voux to a new server
- Reinstall the app
- Accidentally delete counters

It is a good idea to download a backup once in a while, **especially before updating Voux**.
